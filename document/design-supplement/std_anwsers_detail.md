# Standard Answers Detail Presentation

in the page /std-answers  
I think I need not to link the attributes  
related question id and original candidate answer id  
to the related page  

I just need to present the content of them in the detail button page  
(if it cause too large request, this can be down when I click the detail button and then request the related info of them(if there is the api can do this))  

## document

after you have done this modification, please generate a document for this fix

## ver 2

little modification:  

as the content of the standard answers and their corresponded candidate answers is the same  

so no need to present the content of the candidate answers content in the detail page
